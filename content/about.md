The human microbiota is the total of all microbial taxa associated with human beings and consists of an estimated 3 trillion microbes in each persone. The microbiome is the catalog of these microbes and their genes. Although there is microbiota located in various places in/on the body (skin, ear, gut, mouth, etc.), the human gut microbiome is of particular interest, because it hosts the largest population of microorganisms, and alone represents ~3.3 million non-redundant microbial genes. This outnumbers the human genome by a ratio of ~150:1.
