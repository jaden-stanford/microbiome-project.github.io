Gut microorganisms are located in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and comprise bacteria, archaea, and eukarya; they have co-evolved with human hosts over thousands of years to form a symbiotic relationship. The GI tract has one of the largest interfaces (250-400 m^2) between the host, environment, and antigens. Around 60 tonnes of food pass through the human GI tract in an
average lifespan, which exposes the host microbiota to a variety of organisms from the environment which can change microbial composition.

The human gut microbiota has vital functions within the body, including maintaining immune and metabolic homeostasis, strengthening gut integrity, harvesting energy, and protecting against pathogens. Recent lab techniques have revealed that the human gut microbiota functions effectively as a separate organ. Imbalances of gut microbiota (dysbiosis) are linked with
gastrointestinal conditions like reflux, peptic ulcers, IBS, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and inflammatory bowel disease. Dysbiosis is also linked to systemic conditions like obesity, atherosclerosis, Type II Diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s. Maintaining a healthy and balanced gut microbiota is therefore essential to good health.

Many factors can influence the gut microbiome, including the environment (geographical location, urban/rural living), antibiotics, host immune systems, disease, lifestyle (smoking, exercise, mental health), and diet.These factors can have huge effects on the diversityof a particular host’s microbiome; human genomes are about 99% identical to each other, but
their gut microbiomes can be up to 80-90% different.

Research has established diet as one of the primary factors in
shaping the gut microbiota over the course of a lifetime1 and is
thought to explain over 20% of the variability in gut microbiota in humans. Different diets affect the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome by introducing new microbes from food. Diets can induce shifts in the gut
microbiota, with prolonged dietary changes potentially inducing permanent alterations.

Different diets, and their capacity to influence and change the gut microbiota, are therefore of immense interest. As nutritional knowledge develops and different diets are increasing in popularity, there has been an increase in demand for up-to-date and in-depth dietary advice. Vegetarian and vegan
diets have gained increasing popularity recently as part of a growing social movement. The number of U.S. consumers identifying as vegan grew from 1% to 6% between 2014 and 20172. There is also a growing interest in plant-based foods by consumers who don’t consider themselves vegan or vegetarian. Research has shown that extreme diets, such as ‘animal-based’
or ‘plant-based,’ cause significant alterations of the human gut microbiota. Although vegan and vegetarian diets are two of the most well-known alternative diets, other diets like pescatarian are also gaining popularity.
